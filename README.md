A python 3 script that writes mlb scores to standard output

The scores probably only update every five or so minutes, haven't figured out exactly.

there are two scripts:
score-cli-soccer.py does soccer scores
score-cli.py does mlb scores

there is some ansi color hardcoding, it looks good in iterm2. in os x terminal it is kinda weird, and it hasn't been tested anywhere else.

outside package requirements specified in the requirements.txt file. use `pip install -r requirements.txt`
